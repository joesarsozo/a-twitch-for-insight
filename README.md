# a-twitch-for-insight
Hello and welcome to our CSE163 Final Project! This project explores data pulled from twitch that deals with **Top Streamers** and **Top Games** being streamed. Using data we hoped to answer our research questions and find any insights and correlations between the two.
GitHub [***Link Here***](https://github.com/joesarsozo/a-twitch-for-insight)

## Instructions
1. Download Python and a compiler or an IDE such as **PyCharm**, **VS Code** **etc..** if don't already have those installed.
> ***Note:*** *An online environment should work as well!*

2. Grab the required libraries: **Plotly** and **Pandas**, as they are needed to make the
module run.
3. After downloading the necessary dependencies and extracting the .zip file or cloning the GitHub repository into the desired space, open the ***testing.py*** module.
4. Inside the ***testing.py*** module, clicking the run button on your selected environment should execute our code.
> The ***analysis.py*** module contains all the necessary code for the ***testing.py*** module to work.
So please ***Do not*** edit that module!
>

5. Several graphs will be opened up in your browser once the code has finished executing.
Granted you have everything set up and installed correctly.

## Things of Note
- The graphs can have areas ***selected and highlighted*** to just view specific sections
- Graphs can have certain **toggles** on the side that can change what is being shown

## Links
All the links should take you to the corresponding website for each Dependency.
Aside from Plotly and Pandas, the datasets ***should come with cloning the repository or in the .zip file***,
should they not the links are for them are also included below.
